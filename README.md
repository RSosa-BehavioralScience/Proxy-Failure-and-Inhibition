# Proxy-Failure-and-Inhibition

Simulations accompanying the paper 'The Adaptive Value of Behavioral Inhibition' feature an agent thriving in increasingly complex environments that require distinct behavioral strategies for successful adaptation.

Building on the tenets of perceptual control theory and associative learning, this paper presents a plausible model of maladaptive goal pursuit and a mechanism (inhibitory learning and performance) to disengage from proxy traps that generate it. The assumptions underlying this framework include: behavioral variation to reduce need in the absence of information, goal-path streamlining (gradient climbing or descending) through adaptive gains, affective value update via correction of prediction errors supported by a feedback increase function, affective modulation of adaptive gains, and the integration of affective valence and feedback gains from different sources.

INSTRUCTIONS

Open and run the R scripts according to their numbering; always run in that order.

Install the packages called throughout the scripts as needed.

Do not skip any portion or run the same script twice or unexpected outcomes could happen.

If you think you lost yourself in the process, it might be better to start all over.

If you need to interrupt the process (e.g., by closing your computer) and resume later, remember to save your data. When you continue, ensure all required packages are loaded.

Carefully read the annotations in the scripts and follow instructions.

If you notice any issues, please feel free to reach out to the author.
